                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify

agent-base
==========
### Turn a function into an [`http.Agent`][http.Agent] instance
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` generator. That is, you pass it an async
callback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the
given callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.

#### Some subclasses:

Here's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.
Send a pull request to list yours!

 * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints
 * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints
 * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
 * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install agent-base
```


Example
-------

Here's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server
for every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):

```js
var net = require('net');
var tls = require('tls');
var url = require('url');
var http = require('http');
var agent = require('agent-base');

var endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/';
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);

// This is the important part!
parsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {
  var socket;
  // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module
  if (opts.secureEndpoint) {
    socket = tls.connect(opts);
  } else {
    socket = net.connect(opts);
  }
  return socket;
});

// Everything else works just like normal...
http.get(parsed, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

Returning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:

```js
agent(async function (req, opts) {
  await sleep(1000);
  // etc…
});
```

Return another `http.Agent` instance to "pass through" the responsibility
for that HTTP request to that agent:

```js
agent(function (req, opts) {
  return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent;
});
```


API
---

## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]

Creates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback`
for every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function
is responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be
used as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.

The `options` object accepts the following properties:

  * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).

The callback function should have the following signature:

### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined

The ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and
and the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed
to the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted
to be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however
else you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to
the callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will
continue to proceed.

If the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the
`secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - assert-plus@1.0.0

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# assert-plus

This library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two
things: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable
NODE\_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like
`assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks
like this:

```javascript
    var assert = require('assert-plus');

    function fooAccount(options, callback) {
        assert.object(options, 'options');
        assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');
        assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');
        assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');
        assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');
        assert.func(callback, 'callback');

        // Do stuff
        callback(null, {});
    }
```

# API

All methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to
take an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError`
will be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:

    AssertionError: foo (string) is required
    at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)
    at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)
    at Object..js (module.js:464:10)
    at Module.load (module.js:353:31)
    at Function._load (module.js:311:12)
    at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)
    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)

from:

```javascript
    function test(foo) {
        assert.string(foo, 'foo');
    }
```

There you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:

```javascript
    function test(foo) {
        assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');
    }
```

You can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):

```javascript
    assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo');
```

Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the
environment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have
lots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in
production.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are
also disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from
the `assert` module avoids this behavior.

The complete list of APIs is:

* assert.array
* assert.bool
* assert.buffer
* assert.func
* assert.number
* assert.finite
* assert.object
* assert.string
* assert.stream
* assert.date
* assert.regexp

* assert.arrayOfUuid
* assert.optionalArray
* assert.optionalBool
* assert.optionalBuffer
* assert.optionalFunc
* assert.optionalNumber

* assert.optionalArrayOfBuffer
* assert.optionalArrayOfFunc
* assert.optionalArrayOfNumber
* assert.optionalArrayOfFinite
* assert.optionalArrayOfObject
* assert.optionalArrayOfString
* assert.optionalArrayOfStream
* assert.optionalArrayOfDate
* assert.optionalArrayOfRegexp

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - https-proxy-agent@5.0.0

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

https-proxy-agent
================
### An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified
HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `https` module.

Specifically, this `Agent` implementation connects to an intermediary "proxy"
server and issues the [CONNECT HTTP method][CONNECT], which tells the proxy to
open a direct TCP connection to the destination server.

Since this agent implements the CONNECT HTTP method, it also works with other
protocols that use this method when connecting over proxies (i.e. WebSockets).
See the "Examples" section below for more.


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install https-proxy-agent
```


Examples
--------

#### `https` module example

``` js
var url = require('url');
var https = require('https');
var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTPS endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://graph.facebook.com/tootallnate';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var options = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(proxy);
options.agent = agent;

https.get(options, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `ws` WebSocket connection example

``` js
var url = require('url');
var WebSocket = require('ws');
var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org';
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);
console.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);

// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var options = url.parse(proxy);

var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(options);

// finally, initiate the WebSocket connection
var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });

socket.on('open', function () {
  console.log('"open" event!');
  socket.send('hello world');
});

socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {
  console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags);
  socket.close();
});
```

API
---

### new HttpsProxyAgent(Object options)

The `HttpsProxyAgent` class implements an `http.Agent` subclass that connects
to the specified "HTTP(s) proxy server" in order to proxy HTTPS and/or WebSocket
requests. This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].

The `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an
"options" object with more specific properties:

  * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.
  * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.
  * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.
  * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.
  * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - imurmurhash@0.1.4

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

iMurmurHash.js
==============

An incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).

This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.

Installation
------------

To use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js"></script>
<script>
// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3
</script>
```

---

To use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:

```bash
npm install imurmurhash
```

Then simply include it in your scripts:

```javascript
MurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');
```

Quick Example
-------------

```javascript
// Create the initial hash
var hashState = MurmurHash3('string');

// Incrementally add text
hashState.hash('more strings');
hashState.hash('even more strings');

// All calls can be chained if desired
hashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');

// Get a result
hashState.result();
// returns 0xe4ccfe6b
```

Functions
---------

### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])
Get a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:

```javascript
// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same
// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)
hashState = MurmurHash3();
...

// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the
// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss
// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.
hashState = new MurmurHash3();
```

Both methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)
Incrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()
Get the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.

```javascript
// Do the whole string at once
MurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();
// 0x70529328

// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part
var m = MurmurHash3('this is a');
m.result();
// 0xbfc4f834
m.hash(' test string').result();
// 0x70529328 (same as above)
```

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])
Reset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

## Why Joiful?

This lib allows you to apply Joi validation constraints on class properties, by using decorators.

This means you can combine your type schema and your validation schema in one go!

Calling `Validator.validateAsClass()` allows you to validate any object as if it were an instance of a given class.

## Installation

`npm add joiful`

Or

`yarn add joiful`.

You must enable experimental decorators and metadata in your TypeScript configuration.

`tsconfig.json`

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
    "experimentalDecorators": true
  }
}
```

## Basic Usage

```typescript
import * as jf from 'joiful';

class SignUp {
  @jf.string().required()
  username: string;

  @jf
    .string()
    .required()
    .min(8)
  password: string;

  @jf.date()
  dateOfBirth: Date;

  @jf.boolean().required()
  subscribedToNewsletter: boolean;
}

const signUp = new SignUp();
signUp.username = 'rick.sanchez';
signUp.password = 'wubbalubbadubdub';

const { error } = jf.validate(signUp);

console.log(error); // Error will either be undefined or a standard joi validation error
```

## Validate plain old javascript objects

Don't like creating instances of classes? Don't worry, you don't have to. You can validate a plain old javascript object as if it were an instance of a class.

```typescript
const signUp = {
  username: 'rick.sanchez',
  password: 'wubbalubbadubdub',
};

const result = jf.validateAsClass(signUp, SignUp);
```

## Custom decorator constraints

Want to create your own shorthand versions of decorators? Simply create a function like below.

`customDecorators.ts`

```typescript
import * as jf from 'joiful';

const password = () =>
  jf
    .string()
    .min(8)
    .regex(/[a-z]/)
    .regex(/[A-Z]/)
    .regex(/[0-9]/)
    .required();
```

`changePassword.ts`

```typescript
import { password } from './customDecorators';

class ChangePassword {
  @password()
  newPassword: string;
}
```

## Validating array properties

```typescript
class SimpleTodoList {
  @jf.array().items(joi => joi.string())
  todos?: string[];
}
```

To validate an array of objects that have their own joiful validation:

```typescript
class Actor {
  @string().required()
  name!: string;
}

class Movie {
  @string().required()
  name!: string;

  @array({ elementClass: Actor }).required()
  actors!: Actor[];
}
```

## Validating object properties

To validate an object subproperty that has its own joiful validation:

```typescript
class Address {
  @string()
  line1?: string;

  @string()
  line2?: string;

  @string().required()
  city!: string;

  @string().required()
  state!: string;

  @string().required()
  country!: string;
}

class Contact {
  @string().required()
  name!: string;

  @object().optional()
  address?: Address;
}
```

## Got a question?

The joiful API is designed to closely match the joi API. One exception is validating the length of a `string`, `array`, etc, which is performed using `.exactLength(n)` rather than `.length(n)`. If you're familiar with the joi API, you should find joiful very easy to pickup.

If there's something you're not sure of you can see how it's done by looking at the unit tests. There is 100% coverage so most likely you'll find your scenario there. Otherwise feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/joiful-ts/joiful/issues).

[Pull-requests](https://github.com/joiful-ts/joiful/pulls) are also very welcome.

## Alternatives

- [class-validator](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator): usable in both Node.js and the browser. Mostly designed for validating string values. Can't validate plain objects, only class instances.
- [joi-extract-type](https://github.com/TCMiranda/joi-extract-type): provides native type extraction from Joi Schemas. Augments the Joi type definitions.
- [typesafe-joi](https://github.com/hjkcai/typesafe-joi): automatically infers type information of validated objects, via the standard Joi schema API.

      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - noms@0.0.0

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

noms
====

create super easy readable-streams filled with yummy data to nom on, inspired by [from2](https://github.com/hughsk/from2) (and a test based on one from there).

```bash
npm install noms
```

```js
var noms = require('noms');
```

Create a quick readable stream

```js
nom([options], read, [before]);
```

options is optional and passed to readable stream just like in from2 or through2

read is the main read function, it is similar to the original node streams but size is optional and a callback is passed.  It will NOT be called again until the callback is called.

before is called right before the first call to read in order to do setup, it is passed a callback and read will not be called until the callback is called.

like through2 and from2 noms also features

```js
nom.obj([options], read, [before]);
```

which is shorthand for creating an object stream and like from2 noms has

```js
noms.ctor(read, [before]);
```

which returns a constructor function for use if you're creating a large number of copies of the stream.

example (based on one from from2):

```js
function fromString(string) {
  return noms(function(size, next) {
    // if there's no more content
    // left in the string, close the stream.
    if (string.length <= 0) {
      return this.push(null);
    }

    // Pull in a new chunk of text,
    // removing it from the string.
    var chunk = string.slice(0, size);
    string = string.slice(size);

    // Emit "chunk" from the stream.
    next(null, chunk);
  })
}
```

you can use `this.push(foo)` and `next(null, foo)` interchangeably, just remember to call next at the end.

```js
function fromString(string) {
  return noms(function(size, next) {
    // if there's no more content
    // left in the string, close the stream.
    if (string.length <= 0) {
      return next(null, null);
    }

    // Pull in a new chunk of text,
    // removing it from the string.
    var chunk = string.slice(0, size);
    string = string.slice(size);

    // Emit "chunk" from the stream.
    this.push(chunk);
    // finish up
    next();
  })
}
```

If you don't care about size you can omit it

```js
function fromString(sentence) {
  var strings = sentence.trim().split(/\s+/);
  var i = -1;
  var len = strings.length;
  return noms(function(next) {
    // if there's no more content
    // left in the string, close the stream.
    if (++i < len) {
      return this.push(strings[i]);
    } else {
     return this.push(null);
    }
    next();
}
```

You don't have to worry about the response from this.push, as noms will call the function again after you call next until the cache is full.

```js
var fs = require('fs');
var path = require('path');
function getFiles(dir) {
  var stack = [path.resolve(dir)];
  return noms(function(next) {
    if (!stack.length) {
      //we are done
      return next(null, null);
    }
    var self = this;
    var current = stack.pop();
    fs.readdir(current, function (err, paths) {
      if (err) {
        return next(err);
      }
      if (!paths.length) {
        // this directory is empty
        return next();
      }
     var todo = paths.length;
     paths.forEach(function (file) {
        var fullPath = path.join(current, file);
        fs.stat(fullPath, function (err, stats) {
          todo--;
          if (err) {
            return next(err);
          }
          if (stats.isFile()) {
            //found a file
            // emit it as data
            self.push(fullPath);
          } else if (stats.isDirectory()) {
            // found another directory
            // put it into the stack
            // is depth first, switch this to
            // a shift to make it breadth first
            stack.push(fullPath);
          }
          if (!todo) {
            // we've done all the files
            // would be a lot simpler if I used promises
            // would that help or hurt the example?
            next();
          }
        });
      });
    });

}

For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

    "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
    the copyright owner that is granting the License.

    "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
    other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
    control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
    "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
    direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
    otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
    outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

    "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
    exercising permissions granted by this License.

    "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
    including but not limited to software source code, documentation
    source, and configuration files.

    "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
    transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
    not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
    and conversions to other media types.

    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
    to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
    submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
    or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
    the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
    and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
    Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
    excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
    subsequently incorporated within the Work.

 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
    as of the date such litigation is filed.

 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
    meet the following conditions:

    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that You changed the files; and

    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
        the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
        as modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
    the conditions stated in this License.

 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

TypeORM is an [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping)
that can run in NodeJS, Browser, Cordova, PhoneGap, Ionic, React Native, NativeScript, Expo, and Electron platforms
and can be used with TypeScript and JavaScript (ES5, ES6, ES7, ES8).
Its goal is to always support the latest JavaScript features and provide additional features
that help you to develop any kind of application that uses databases - from
small applications with a few tables to large scale enterprise applications
with multiple databases.

TypeORM supports both [Active Record](./docs/active-record-data-mapper.md#what-is-the-active-record-pattern) and [Data Mapper](./docs/active-record-data-mapper.md#what-is-the-data-mapper-pattern) patterns,
unlike all other JavaScript ORMs currently in existence,
which means you can write high quality, loosely coupled, scalable,
maintainable applications the most productive way.

TypeORM is highly influenced by other ORMs, such as [Hibernate](http://hibernate.org/orm/),
 [Doctrine](http://www.doctrine-project.org/) and [Entity Framework](https://www.asp.net/entity-framework).

Some TypeORM features:

* supports both [DataMapper](./docs/active-record-data-mapper.md#what-is-the-data-mapper-pattern) and [ActiveRecord](./docs/active-record-data-mapper.md#what-is-the-active-record-pattern) (your choice)
* entities and columns
* database-specific column types
* entity manager
* repositories and custom repositories
* clean object relational model
* associations (relations)
* eager and lazy relations
* uni-directional, bi-directional and self-referenced relations
* supports multiple inheritance patterns
* cascades
* indices
* transactions
* migrations and automatic migrations generation
* connection pooling
* replication
* using multiple database connections
* working with multiple databases types
* cross-database and cross-schema queries
* elegant-syntax, flexible and powerful QueryBuilder
* left and inner joins
* proper pagination for queries using joins
* query caching
* streaming raw results
* logging
* listeners and subscribers (hooks)
* supports closure table pattern
* schema declaration in models or separate configuration files
* connection configuration in json / xml / yml / env formats
* supports MySQL / MariaDB / Postgres / CockroachDB / SQLite / Microsoft SQL Server / Oracle / SAP Hana / sql.js
* supports MongoDB NoSQL database
* works in NodeJS / Browser / Ionic / Cordova / React Native / NativeScript / Expo / Electron platforms
* TypeScript and JavaScript support
* produced code is performant, flexible, clean and maintainable
* follows all possible best practices
* CLI

And more...

With TypeORM your models look like this:

```javascript
import {Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column} from "typeorm";

@Entity()
export class User {

    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number;

    @Column()
    firstName: string;

    @Column()
    lastName: string;

    @Column()
    age: number;

}
```

And your domain logic looks like this:

```javascript
const user = new User();
user.firstName = "Timber";
user.lastName = "Saw";
user.age = 25;
await repository.save(user);

const allUsers = await repository.find();
const firstUser = await repository.findOne(1); // find by id
const timber = await repository.findOne({ firstName: "Timber", lastName: "Saw" });

await repository.remove(timber);
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to use the `ActiveRecord` implementation, you can use it as well:

```javascript
import {Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column, BaseEntity} from "typeorm";

@Entity()
export class User extends BaseEntity {

    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number;

    @Column()
    firstName: string;

    @Column()
    lastName: string;

    @Column()
    age: number;

}
```

And your domain logic will look this way:

```javascript
const user = new User();
user.firstName = "Timber";
user.lastName = "Saw";
user.age = 25;
await user.save();

const allUsers = await User.find();
const firstUser = await User.findOne(1);
const timber = await User.findOne({ firstName: "Timber", lastName: "Saw" });

await timber.remove();
```

## Installation


1. Install the npm package:

    `npm install typeorm --save`

2. You need to install `reflect-metadata` shim:

    `npm install reflect-metadata --save`

    and import it somewhere in the global place of your app (for example in `app.ts`):

    `import "reflect-metadata";`

3. You may need to install node typings:

    `npm install @types/node --save`

4. Install a database driver:

    * for **MySQL** or **MariaDB**

        `npm install mysql --save` (you can install `mysql2` instead as well)

    * for **PostgreSQL** or **CockroachDB**

        `npm install pg --save`

    * for **SQLite**

        `npm install sqlite3 --save`

    * for **Microsoft SQL Server**

        `npm install mssql --save`

    * for **sql.js**

        `npm install sql.js --save`

    * for **Oracle**

        `npm install oracledb --save`

        To make the Oracle driver work, you need to follow the installation instructions from
        [their](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb) site.

    * for **SAP Hana**

        ```
        npm config set @sap:registry https://npm.sap.com
        npm i @sap/hdbext
        ```

    * for **MongoDB** (experimental)

        `npm install mongodb --save`

    * for **NativeScript**, **react-native** and **Cordova**

        Check [documentation of supported platforms](./docs/supported-platforms.md)

    Install only *one* of them, depending on which database you use.


##### TypeScript configuration

Also, make sure you are using TypeScript version **3.3** or higher,
and you have enabled the following settings in `tsconfig.json`:

```json
"emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
"experimentalDecorators": true,
```

You may also need to enable `es6` in the `lib` section of compiler options, or install `es6-shim` from `@types`.

## Quick Start

The quickest way to get started with TypeORM is to use its CLI commands to generate a starter project.
Quick start works only if you are using TypeORM in a NodeJS application.
If you are using other platforms, proceed to the [step-by-step guide](#step-by-step-guide).

First, install TypeORM globally:

```
npm install typeorm -g
```

Then go to the directory where you want to create a new project and run the command:

```
typeorm init --name MyProject --database mysql
```

Where `name` is the name of your project and `database` is the database you'll use.
Database can be one of the following values: `mysql`, `mariadb`, `postgres`, `cockroachdb`, `sqlite`, `mssql`, `oracle`, `mongodb`,
`cordova`, `react-native`, `expo`, `nativescript`.

This command will generate a new project in the `MyProject` directory with the following files:

```
MyProject
├── src              // place of your TypeScript code
│   ├── entity       // place where your entities (database models) are stored
│   │   └── User.ts  // sample entity
│   ├── migration    // place where your migrations are stored
│   └── index.ts     // start point of your application
├── .gitignore       // standard gitignore file
├── ormconfig.json   // ORM and database connection configuration
├── package.json     // node module dependencies
├── README.md        // simple readme file
└── tsconfig.json    // TypeScript compiler options
```

> You can also run `typeorm init` on an existing node project, but be careful - it may override some files you already have.

The next step is to install new project dependencies:

```
cd MyProject
npm install
```

While installation is in progress, edit the `ormconfig.json` file and put your own database connection configuration options in there:

```json
{
   "type": "mysql",
   "host": "localhost",
   "port": 3306,
   "username": "test",
   "password": "test",
   "database": "test",
   "synchronize": true,
   "logging": false,
   "entities": [
      "src/entity/**/*.ts"
   ],
   "migrations": [
      "src/migration/**/*.ts"
   ],
   "subscribers": [
      "src/subscriber/**/*.ts"
   ]
}
```

Particularly, most of the time you'll only need to configure
`host`, `username`, `password`, `database` and maybe `port` options.

Once you finish with configuration and all node modules are installed, you can run your application:

```
npm start
```

That's it, your application should successfully run and insert a new user into the database.
You can continue to work with this project and integrate other modules you need and start
creating more entities.

> You can generate an even more advanced project with express installed by running
`typeorm init --name MyProject --database mysql --express` command.

## Step-by-Step Guide

What are you expecting from ORM?
First of all, you are expecting it will create database tables for you
and find / insert / update / delete your data without the pain of
having to write lots of hardly maintainable SQL queries.
This guide will show you how to setup TypeORM from scratch and make it do what you are expecting from an ORM.

### Create a model

Working with a database starts from creating tables.
How do you tell TypeORM to create a database table?
The answer is - through the models.
Your models in your app are your database tables.

For example, you have a `Photo` model:

```javascript
export class Photo {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    description: string;
    filename: string;
    views: number;
    isPublished: boolean;
}
```

And you want to store photos in your database.
To store things in the database, first you need a database table,
and database tables are created from your models.
Not all models, but only those you define as *entities*.

### Create an entity

*Entity* is your model decorated by an `@Entity` decorator.
A database table will be created for such models.
You work with entities everywhere with TypeORM.
You can load/insert/update/remove and perform other operations with them.

Let's make our `Photo` model as an entity:

```javascript
import {Entity} from "typeorm";

@Entity()
export class Photo {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    description: string;
    filename: string;
    views: number;
    isPublished: boolean;
}
```

Now, a database table will be created for the `Photo` entity and we'll be able to work with it anywhere in our app.
We have created a database table, however what table can exist without columns?
Let's create a few columns in our database table.

### Adding table columns

To add database columns, you simply need to decorate an entity's properties you want to make into a column
with a `@Column` decorator.

```javascript
import {Entity, Column} from "typeorm";

@Entity()
export class Photo {

    @Column()
    id: number;

    @Column()
    name: string;

    @Column()
    description: string;

    @Column()
    filename: string;

    @Column()
    views: number;

    @Column()
    isPublished: boolean;
}
```

Now `id`, `name`, `description`, `filename`, `views` and `isPublished` columns will be added to the `photo` table.
Column types in the database are inferred from the property types you used, e.g.
`number` will be converted into `integer`, `string` into `varchar`, `boolean` into `bool`, etc.
But you can use any column type your database supports by implicitly specifying a column type into the `@Column` decorator.

We generated a database table with columns, but there is one thing left.
Each database table must have a column with a primary key.

### Creating a primary column

Each entity **must** have at least one primary key column.
This is a requirement and you can't avoid it.
To make a column a primary key, you need to use `@PrimaryColumn` decorator.

```javascript
import {Entity, Column, PrimaryColumn} from "typeorm";

@Entity()
export class Photo {

    @PrimaryColumn()
    id: number;

    @Column()
    name: string;

    @Column()
    description: string;

    @Column()
    filename: string;

    @Column()
    views: number;

    @Column()
    isPublished: boolean;
}
```

### Creating an auto generated column

Now, let's say you want your id column to be auto-generated (this is known as auto-increment / sequence / serial / generated identity column).
To do that, you need to change the `@PrimaryColumn` decorator to a `@PrimaryGeneratedColumn` decorator:

```javascript
import {Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn} from "typeorm";

@Entity()
export class Photo {

    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number;

    @Column()
    name: string;

    @Column()
    description: string;

    @Column()
    filename: string;

    @Column()
    views: number;

    @Column()
    isPublished: boolean;
}
```

### Column data types

Next, let's fix our data types. By default, string is mapped to a varchar(255)-like type (depending on the database type).
Number is mapped to a integer-like type (depending on the database type).
We don't want all our columns to be limited varchars or integers.
Let's setup correct data types:

```javascript
import {Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn} from "typeorm";

@Entity()
export class Photo {

    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number;

    @Column({
        length: 100
    })
    name: string;

    @Column("text")
    description: string;

    @Column()
    filename: string;

    @Column("double")
    views: number;

    @Column()
    isPublished: boolean;
}
```

Column types are database-specific.
You can set any column type your database supports.
More information on supported column types can be found [here](./docs/entities.md#column-types).

### Creating a connection to the database

Now, when our entity is created, let's create an `index.ts` (or `app.ts` whatever you call it) file and set up our connection there:

```javascript
import "reflect-metadata";
import {createConnection} from "typeorm";
import {Photo} from "./entity/Photo";

createConnection({
    type: "mysql",
    host: "localhost",
    port: 3306,
    username: "root",
    password: "admin",
    database: "test",
    entities: [
        Photo
    ],
    synchronize: true,
    logging: false
}).then(connection => {
    // here you can start to work with your entities
}).catch(error => console.log(error));
```

We are using MySQL in this example, but you can use any other supported database.
To use another database, simply change the `type` in the options to the database type you are using:
`mysql`, `mariadb`, `postgres`, `cockroachdb`, `sqlite`, `mssql`, `oracle`, `cordova`, `nativescript`, `react-native`,
`expo`, or `mongodb`.
Also make sure to use your own host, port, username, password and database settings.

We added our Photo entity to the list of entities for this connection.
Each entity you are using in your connection must be listed there.

Setting `synchronize` makes sure your entities will be synced with the database, every time you run the application.

### Loading all entities from the directory

Later, when we create more entities we need to add them to the entities in our configuration.
This is not very convenient, so instead we can set up the whole directory, from where all entities will be connected and used in our connection:

```javascript
import {createConnection} from "typeorm";

createConnection({
    type: "mysql",
    host: "localhost",
    port: 3306,
    username: "root",
    password: "admin",
    database: "test",
    entities: [
        __dirname + "/entity/*.js"
    ],
    synchronize: true,
}).then(connection => {
    // here you can start to work with your entities
}).catch(error => console.log(error));
```

But be careful with this approach.
If you are using `ts-node` then you need to specify paths to `.ts` files instead.
If you are using `outDir` then you'll need to specify paths to `.js` files inside outDir directory.
If you are using `outDir` and when you remove or rename your entities make sure to clear `outDir` directory
and re-compile your project again, because when you remove your source `.ts` files their compiled `.js` versions
aren't removed from output directory and still are loaded by TypeORM because they are present in the `outDir` directory.

### Running the application

Now if you run your `index.ts`, a connection with database will be initialized and a database table for your photos will be created.


```shell
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
|                         photo                           |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
| id          | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT |
| name        | varchar(100) |                            |
| description | text         |                            |
| filename    | varchar(255) |                            |
| views       | int(11)      |                            |
| isPublished | boolean      |                            |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
```

### Creating and inserting a photo into the database

Now let's create a new photo to save it in the database:

```javascript
import {createConnection} from "typeorm";
import {Photo} from "./entity/Photo";

createConnection(/*...*/).then(connection => {

    let photo = new Photo();
    photo.name = "Me and Bears";
    photo.description = "I am near polar bears";
    photo.filename = "photo-with-bears.jpg";
    photo.views = 1;
    photo.isPublished = true;

    return connection.manager
            .save(photo)
            .then(photo => {
                console.log("Photo has been saved. Photo id is", photo.id);
            });

}).catch(error => console.log(error));
```

Once your entity is saved it will get a newly generated id.
`save` method returns an instance of the same object you pass to it.
It's not a new copy of the object, it modifies its "id" and returns it.

### Using async/await syntax

Let's take advantage of the latest ES8 (ES2017) features and use async/await syntax instead:

```javascript
import {createConnection} from "typeorm";
import {Photo} from "./entity/Photo";

createConnection(/*...*/).then(async connection => {

    let photo = new Photo();
    photo.name = "Me and Bears";
    photo.description = "I am near polar bears";
    photo.filename = "photo-with-bears.jpg";
    photo.views = 1;
    photo.isPublished = true;

    await connection.manager.save(photo);
    console.log("Photo has been saved");

}).catch(error => console.log(error));
```

### Using Entity Manager

We just created a new photo and saved it in the database.
We used `EntityManager` to save it.
Using entity manager you can manipulate any entity in your app.
For example, let's load our saved entity:

```javascript
import {createConnection} from "typeorm";
import {Photo} from "./entity/Photo";

createConnection(/*...*/).then(async connection => {

    /*...*/
    let savedPhotos = await connection.manager.find(Photo);
    console.log("All photos from the db: ", savedPhotos);

}).catch(error => console.log(error));
```

`savedPhotos` will be an array of Photo objects with the data loaded from the database.

Learn more about EntityManager [here](./docs/working-with-entity-manager.md).

### Using Repositories

Now let's refactor our code and use `Repository` instead of `EntityManager`.
Each entity has its own repository which handles all operations with its entity.
When you deal with entities a lot, Repositories are more convenient to use than EntityManagers:


```javascript
import {createConnection} from "typeorm";
import {Photo} from "./entity/Photo";

createConnection(/*...*/).then(async connection => {

    let photo = new Photo();
    photo.name = "Me and Bears";
    photo.description = "I am near polar bears";
    photo.filename = "photo-with-bears.jpg";
    photo.views = 1;
    photo.isPublished = true;

    let photoRepository = connection.getRepository(Photo);

    await photoRepository.save(photo);
    console.log("Photo has been saved");

    let savedPhotos = await photoRepository.find();
    console.log("All photos from the db: ", savedPhotos);

}).catch(error => console.log(error));
```

Learn more about Repository [here](./docs/working-with-repository.md).

### Loading from the database

Let's try more load operations using the Repository:

```javascript
import {createConnection} from "typeorm";
import {Photo} from "./entity/Photo";

createConnection(/*...*/).then(async connection => {

    /*...*/
    let allPhotos = await photoRepository.find();
    console.log("All photos from the db: ", allPhotos);

    let firstPhoto = await photoRepository.findOne(1);
    console.log("First photo from the db: ", firstPhoto);

    let meAndBearsPhoto = await photoRepository.findOne({ name: "Me and Bears" });
    console.log("Me and Bears photo from the db: ", meAndBearsPhoto);

    let allViewedPhotos = await photoRepository.find({ views: 1 });
    console.log("All viewed photos: ", allViewedPhotos);

    let allPublishedPhotos = await photoRepository.find({ isPublished: true });
    console.log("All published photos: ", allPublishedPhotos);

    let [allPhotos, photosCount] = await photoRepository.findAndCount();
    console.log("All photos: ", allPhotos);
    console.log("Photos count: ", photosCount);

}).catch(error => console.log(error));
```

### Updating in the database

Now let's load a single photo from the database, update it and save it:

```javascript
import {createConnection} from "typeorm";
import {Photo} from "./entity/Photo";

createConnection(/*...*/).then(async connection => {

    /*...*/
    let photoToUpdate = await photoRepository.findOne(1);
    photoToUpdate.name = "Me, my friends and polar bears";
    await photoRepository.save(photoToUpdate);

}).catch(error => console.log(error));
```

Now photo with `id = 1` will be updated in the database.

### Removing from the database

Now let's remove our photo from the database:

```javascript
import {createConnection} from "typeorm";
import {Photo} from "./entity/Photo";

createConnection(/*...*/).then(async connection => {

    /*...*/
    let photoToRemove = await photoRepository.findOne(1);
    await photoRepository.remove(photoToRemove);

}).catch(error => console.log(error));
```

Now photo with `id = 1` will be removed from the database.

### Creating a one-to-one relation

Let's create a one-to-one relation with another class.
Let's create a new class in `PhotoMetadata.ts`. This PhotoMetadata class is supposed to contain our photo's additional meta-information:

```javascript
import {Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, OneToOne, JoinColumn} from "typeorm";
import {Photo} from "./Photo";

@Entity()
export class PhotoMetadata {

    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number;

    @Column("int")
    height: number;

    @Column("int")
    width: number;

    @Column()
    orientation: string;

    @Column()
    compressed: boolean;

    @Column()
    comment: string;

    @OneToOne(type => Photo)
    @JoinColumn()
    photo: Photo;
}
```

Here, we are using a new decorator called `@OneToOne`. It allows us to create a one-to-one relationship between two entities.
`type => Photo` is a function that returns the class of the entity with which we want to make our relationship.
We are forced to use a function that returns a class, instead of using the class directly, because of the language specifics.
We can also write it as `() => Photo`, but we use `type => Photo` as a convention to increase code readability.
The type variable itself does not contain anything.

We also add a `@JoinColumn` decorator, which indicates that this side of the relationship will own the relationship.
Relations can be unidirectional or bidirectional.
Only one side of relational can be owning.
Using `@JoinColumn` decorator is required on the owner side of the relationship.

If you run the app, you'll see a newly generated table, and it will contain a column with a foreign key for the photo relation:

```shell
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
|                     photo_metadata                      |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
| id          | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT |
| height      | int(11)      |                            |
| width       | int(11)      |                            |
| comment     | varchar(255) |                            |
| compressed  | boolean      |                            |
| orientation | varchar(255) |                            |
| photoId     | int(11)      | FOREIGN KEY                |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
```

### Save a one-to-one relation

Now let's save a photo, its metadata and attach them to each other.

```javascript
import {createConnection} from "typeorm";
import {Photo} from "./entity/Photo";
import {PhotoMetadata} from "./entity/PhotoMetadata";

createConnection(/*...*/).then(async connection => {

    // create a photo
    let photo = new Photo();
    photo.name = "Me and Bears";
    photo.description = "I am near polar bears";
    photo.filename = "photo-with-bears.jpg";
    photo.isPublished = true;

    // create a photo metadata
    let metadata = new PhotoMetadata();
    metadata.height = 640;
    metadata.width = 480;
    metadata.compressed = true;
    metadata.comment = "cybershoot";
    metadata.orientation = "portait";
    metadata.photo = photo; // this way we connect them

    // get entity repositories
    let photoRepository = connection.getRepository(Photo);
    let metadataRepository = connection.getRepository(PhotoMetadata);

    // first we should save a photo
    await photoRepository.save(photo);

    // photo is saved. Now we need to save a photo metadata
    await metadataRepository.save(metadata);

    // done
    console.log("Metadata is saved, and relation between metadata and photo is created in the database too");

}).catch(error => console.log(error));
```

### Inverse side of the relationship

Relations can be unidirectional or bidirectional.
Currently, our relation between PhotoMetadata and Photo is unidirectional.
The owner of the relation is PhotoMetadata, and Photo doesn't know anything about PhotoMetadata.
This makes it complicated to access PhotoMetadata from the Photo side.
To fix this issue we should add an inverse relation, and make relations between PhotoMetadata and Photo bidirectional.
Let's modify our entities:

```javascript
import {Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, OneToOne, JoinColumn} from "typeorm";
import {Photo} from "./Photo";

@Entity()
export class PhotoMetadata {

    /* ... other columns */

    @OneToOne(type => Photo, photo => photo.metadata)
    @JoinColumn()
    photo: Photo;
}
```

```javascript
import {Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, OneToOne} from "typeorm";
import {PhotoMetadata} from "./PhotoMetadata";

@Entity()
export class Photo {

    /* ... other columns */

    @OneToOne(type => PhotoMetadata, photoMetadata => photoMetadata.photo)
    metadata: PhotoMetadata;
}
```

`photo => photo.metadata` is a function that returns the name of the inverse side of the relation.
Here we show that the metadata property of the Photo class is where we store PhotoMetadata in the Photo class.
Instead of passing a function that returns a property of the photo, you could alternatively simply pass a string to `@OneToOne` decorator, like `"metadata"`.
But we used this function-typed approach to make our refactoring easier.

Note that we should use `@JoinColumn` decorator only on one side of a relation.
Whichever side you put this decorator on will be the owning side of the relationship.
The owning side of a relationship contains a column with a foreign key in the database.

### Loading objects with their relations

Now let's load our photo and its photo metadata in a single query.
There are two ways to do it - using `find*` methods or using `QueryBuilder` functionality.
Let's use `find*` methods first.
`find*` methods allow you to specify an object with the `FindOneOptions` / `FindManyOptions` interface.

```javascript
import {createConnection} from "typeorm";
import {Photo} from "./entity/Photo";
import {PhotoMetadata} from "./entity/PhotoMetadata";

createConnection(/*...*/).then(async connection => {

    /*...*/
    let photoRepository = connection.getRepository(Photo);
    let photos = await photoRepository.find({ relations: ["metadata"] });

}).catch(error => console.log(error));
```

Here, photos will contain an array of photos from the database, and each photo will contain its photo metadata.
Learn more about Find Options in [this documentation](./docs/find-options.md).

Using find options is good and dead simple, but if you need a more complex query, you should use `QueryBuilder` instead.
`QueryBuilder` allows more complex queries to be used in an elegant way:

```javascript
import {createConnection} from "typeorm";
import {Photo} from "./entity/Photo";
import {PhotoMetadata} from "./entity/PhotoMetadata";

createConnection(/*...*/).then(async connection => {

    /*...*/
    let photos = await connection
            .getRepository(Photo)
            .createQueryBuilder("photo")
            .innerJoinAndSelect("photo.metadata", "metadata")
            .getMany();


}).catch(error => console.log(error));
```

`QueryBuilder` allows creation and execution of SQL queries of almost any complexity.
When you work with `QueryBuilder`, think like you are creating an SQL query.
In this example, "photo" and "metadata" are aliases applied to selected photos.
You use aliases to access columns and properties of the selected data.

### Using cascades to automatically save related objects

We can setup cascade options in our relations, in the cases when we want our related object to be saved whenever the other object is saved.
Let's change our photo's `@OneToOne` decorator a bit:

```javascript
export class Photo {
    /// ... other columns

    @OneToOne(type => PhotoMetadata, metadata => metadata.photo, {
        cascade: true,
    })
    metadata: PhotoMetadata;
}
```

Using `cascade` allows us not to separately save photo and separately save metadata objects now.
Now we can simply save a photo object, and the metadata object will be saved automatically because of cascade options.

```javascript
createConnection(options).then(async connection => {

    // create photo object
    let photo = new Photo();
    photo.name = "Me and Bears";
    photo.description = "I am near polar bears";
    photo.filename = "photo-with-bears.jpg";
    photo.isPublished = true;

    // create photo metadata object
    let metadata = new PhotoMetadata();
    metadata.height = 640;
    metadata.width = 480;
    metadata.compressed = true;
    metadata.comment = "cybershoot";
    metadata.orientation = "portait";

    photo.metadata = metadata; // this way we connect them

    // get repository
    let photoRepository = connection.getRepository(Photo);

    // saving a photo also save the metadata
    await photoRepository.save(photo);

    console.log("Photo is saved, photo metadata is saved too.")

}).catch(error => console.log(error));
```

### Creating a many-to-one / one-to-many relation

Let's create a many-to-one / one-to-many relation.
Let's say a photo has one author, and each author can have many photos.
First, let's create an `Author` class:

```javascript
import {Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, OneToMany, JoinColumn} from "typeorm";
import {Photo} from "./Photo";

@Entity()
export class Author {

    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number;

    @Column()
    name: string;

    @OneToMany(type => Photo, photo => photo.author) // note: we will create author property in the Photo class below
    photos: Photo[];
}
```

`Author` contains an inverse side of a relation.
`OneToMany` is always an inverse side of relation, and it can't exist without `ManyToOne` on the other side of the relation.

Now let's add the owner side of the relation into the Photo entity:

```javascript
import {Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, ManyToOne} from "typeorm";
import {PhotoMetadata} from "./PhotoMetadata";
import {Author} from "./Author";

@Entity()
export class Photo {

    /* ... other columns */

    @ManyToOne(type => Author, author => author.photos)
    author: Author;
}
```

In many-to-one / one-to-many relation, the owner side is always many-to-one.
It means that the class that uses `@ManyToOne` will store the id of the related object.

After you run the application, the ORM will create the `author` table:


```shell
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
|                          author                         |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
| id          | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT |
| name        | varchar(255) |                            |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
```

It will also modify the `photo` table, adding a new `author` column and creating a foreign key for it:

```shell
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
|                         photo                           |

### Creating a many-to-many relation

Let's create a many-to-one / many-to-many relation.
Let's say a photo can be in many albums, and each album can contain many photos.
Let's create an `Album` class:

```javascript
import {Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column, ManyToMany, JoinTable} from "typeorm";

@Entity()
export class Album {

    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number;

    @Column()
    name: string;

    @ManyToMany(type => Photo, photo => photo.albums)
    @JoinTable()
    photos: Photo[];
}
```

`@JoinTable` is required to specify that this is the owner side of the relationship.

Now let's add the inverse side of our relation to the `Photo` class:

```javascript
export class Photo {
    /// ... other columns

    @ManyToMany(type => Album, album => album.photos)
    albums: Album[];
}
```

After you run the application, the ORM will create a **album_photos_photo_albums** *junction table*:

```shell
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
|                album_photos_photo_albums                |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
| album_id    | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY FOREIGN KEY    |
| photo_id    | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY FOREIGN KEY    |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
```

Don't forget to register the `Album` class with your connection in the ORM:

```javascript
const options: ConnectionOptions = {
    // ... other options
    entities: [Photo, PhotoMetadata, Author, Album]
};
```

Now let's insert albums and photos to our database:

```javascript
let connection = await createConnection(options);

// create a few albums
let album1 = new Album();
album1.name = "Bears";
await connection.manager.save(album1);

let album2 = new Album();
album2.name = "Me";
await connection.manager.save(album2);

// create a few photos
let photo = new Photo();
photo.name = "Me and Bears";
photo.description = "I am near polar bears";
photo.filename = "photo-with-bears.jpg";
photo.albums = [album1, album2];
await connection.manager.save(photo);

// now our photo is saved and albums are attached to it
// now lets load them:
const loadedPhoto = await connection
    .getRepository(Photo)
    .findOne(1, { relations: ["albums"] });
```

`loadedPhoto` will be equal to:

```javascript
{
    id: 1,
    name: "Me and Bears",
    description: "I am near polar bears",
    filename: "photo-with-bears.jpg",
    albums: [{
        id: 1,
        name: "Bears"
    }, {
        id: 2,
        name: "Me"
    }]
}
```

### Using QueryBuilder

You can use QueryBuilder to build SQL queries of almost any complexity. For example, you can do this:

```javascript
let photos = await connection
    .getRepository(Photo)
    .createQueryBuilder("photo") // first argument is an alias. Alias is what you are selecting - photos. You must specify it.
    .innerJoinAndSelect("photo.metadata", "metadata")
    .leftJoinAndSelect("photo.albums", "album")
    .where("photo.isPublished = true")
    .andWhere("(photo.name = :photoName OR photo.name = :bearName)")
    .orderBy("photo.id", "DESC")
    .skip(5)
    .take(10)
    .setParameters({ photoName: "My", bearName: "Mishka" })
    .getMany();
```

This query selects all published photos with "My" or "Mishka" names.
It will select results from position 5 (pagination offset),
and will select only 10 results (pagination limit).
The selection result will be ordered by id in descending order.
The photo's albums will be left-joined and their metadata will be inner joined.

You'll use the query builder in your application a lot.
Learn more about QueryBuilder [here](./docs/select-query-builder.md).

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# URI.js

URI.js is an [RFC 3986](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt) compliant, scheme extendable URI parsing/validating/resolving library for all JavaScript environments (browsers, Node.js, etc).
It is also compliant with the IRI ([RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt)), IDNA ([RFC 5890](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5890.txt)), IPv6 Address ([RFC 5952](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5952.txt)), IPv6 Zone Identifier ([RFC 6874](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6874.txt)) specifications.

URI.js has an extensive test suite, and works in all (Node.js, web) environments. It weighs in at 6.2kb (gzipped, 16kb deflated).

## API

### Parsing

	URI.parse("uri://user:pass@example.com:123/one/two.three?q1=a1&q2=a2#body");
	//returns:
	//{
	//  scheme : "uri",
	//  userinfo : "user:pass",
	//  host : "example.com",
	//  port : 123,
	//  path : "/one/two.three",
	//  query : "q1=a1&q2=a2",
	//  fragment : "body"
	//}

### Serializing

	URI.serialize({scheme : "http", host : "example.com", fragment : "footer"}) === "http://example.com/#footer"

### Resolving

	URI.resolve("uri://a/b/c/d?q", "../../g") === "uri://a/g"

### Normalizing

	URI.normalize("HTTP://ABC.com:80/%7Esmith/home.html") === "http://abc.com/~smith/home.html"

### Comparison

	URI.equal("example://a/b/c/%7Bfoo%7D", "eXAMPLE://a/./b/../b/%63/%7bfoo%7d") === true

### IP Support

	//IPv4 normalization
	URI.normalize("//192.068.001.000") === "//192.68.1.0"

	//IPv6 normalization
	URI.normalize("//[2001:0:0DB8::0:0001]") === "//[2001:0:db8::1]"

	//IPv6 zone identifier support
	URI.parse("//[2001:db8::7%25en1]");
	//returns:
	//{
	//  host : "2001:db8::7%en1"
	//}

### IRI Support

	//convert IRI to URI
	URI.serialize(URI.parse("http://examplé.org/rosé")) === "http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9"
	//convert URI to IRI
	URI.serialize(URI.parse("http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9"), {iri:true}) === "http://examplé.org/rosé"

### Options

All of the above functions can accept an additional options argument that is an object that can contain one or more of the following properties:

*	`scheme` (string)

	Indicates the scheme that the URI should be treated as, overriding the URI's normal scheme parsing behavior.

*	`reference` (string)

	If set to `"suffix"`, it indicates that the URI is in the suffix format, and the validator will use the option's `scheme` property to determine the URI's scheme.

*	`tolerant` (boolean, false)

	If set to `true`, the parser will relax URI resolving rules.

*	`absolutePath` (boolean, false)

	If set to `true`, the serializer will not resolve a relative `path` component.

*	`iri` (boolean, false)

	If set to `true`, the serializer will unescape non-ASCII characters as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).

*	`unicodeSupport` (boolean, false)

	If set to `true`, the parser will unescape non-ASCII characters in the parsed output as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).

*	`domainHost` (boolean, false)

	If set to `true`, the library will treat the `host` component as a domain name, and convert IDNs (International Domain Names) as per [RFC 5891](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5891.txt).

## Scheme Extendable

URI.js supports inserting custom [scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme) dependent processing rules. Currently, URI.js has built in support for the following schemes:

*	http \[[RFC 2616](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt)\]
*	https \[[RFC 2818](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2818.txt)\]
*	mailto \[[RFC 6068](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6068.txt)\]
*	urn \[[RFC 2141](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt)\]
*	urn:uuid \[[RFC 4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt)\]

### HTTP Support

	URI.equal("HTTP://ABC.COM:80", "http://abc.com/") === true

### Mailto Support

	URI.parse("mailto:alpha@example.com,bravo@example.com?subject=SUBSCRIBE&body=Sign%20me%20up!");
	//returns:
	//{
	//	scheme : "mailto",
	//	to : ["alpha@example.com", "bravo@example.com"],
	//	subject : "SUBSCRIBE",
	//	body : "Sign me up!"
	//}

	URI.serialize({
		scheme : "mailto",
		to : ["alpha@example.com"],
		subject : "REMOVE",
		body : "Please remove me",
		headers : {
			cc : "charlie@example.com"
		}
	}) === "mailto:alpha@example.com?cc=charlie@example.com&subject=REMOVE&body=Please%20remove%20me"

### URN Support

	URI.parse("urn:example:foo");
	//returns:
	//{
	//	scheme : "urn",
	//	nid : "example",
	//	nss : "foo",
	//}

#### URN UUID Support

	URI.parse("urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6");
	//returns:
	//{
	//	scheme : "urn",
	//	nid : "example",
	//	uuid : "f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6",
	//}

## Usage

To load in a browser, use the following tag:

	<script type="text/javascript" src="uri-js/dist/es5/uri.all.min.js"></script>

To load in a CommonJS (Node.js) environment, first install with npm by running on the command line:

	npm install uri-js

Then, in your code, load it using:

	const URI = require("uri-js");

If you are writing your code in ES6+ (ESNEXT) or TypeScript, you would load it using:

	import * as URI from "uri-js";

Or you can load just what you need using named exports:

	import { parse, serialize, resolve, resolveComponents, normalize, equal, removeDotSegments, pctEncChar, pctDecChars, escapeComponent, unescapeComponent } from "uri-js";

## Breaking changes

### Breaking changes from 3.x

URN parsing has been completely changed to better align with the specification. Scheme is now always `urn`, but has two new properties: `nid` which contains the Namspace Identifier, and `nss` which contains the Namespace Specific String. The `nss` property will be removed by higher order scheme handlers, such as the UUID URN scheme handler.

The UUID of a URN can now be found in the `uuid` property.

### Breaking changes from 2.x

URI validation has been removed as it was slow, exposed a vulnerabilty, and was generally not useful.

### Breaking changes from 1.x

The `errors` array on parsed components is now an `error` string.

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - xpath.js@1.1.0

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

## xpath.js
An xpath module for node, written in pure javascript.

Originally written by Cameron McCormack ([blog](http://mcc.id.au/xpathjs)). 

Prepared as a node module by Yaron Naveh ([blog](http://webservices20.blogspot.com/), [twitter](https://twitter.com/YaronNaveh)).

## Install
Install with [npm](http://github.com/isaacs/npm):

    npm install xpath.js



xpath.js is xml engine agnostic but I recommend to use [xmldom](https://github.com/jindw/xmldom):

    npm install xmldom


## Your first xpath:
`````javascript
	var select = require('xpath.js')
	  , dom = require('xmldom').DOMParser

	var xml = "<book><title>Harry Potter</title></book>"
	var doc = new dom().parseFromString(xml)    
	var nodes = select(doc, "//title")
	console.log(nodes[0].localName + ": " + nodes[0].firstChild.data)
	console.log("node: " + nodes[0].toString())
`````
-->

	title: Harry Potter
	Node: <title>Harry Potter</title>

## Get text values directly
`````javascript 
    var xml = "<book><title>Harry Potter</title></book>"
    var doc = new dom().parseFromString(xml)    
    var title = select(doc, "//title/text()")[0].data   
    console.log(title)
`````  
-->
    
    Harry Potter

## Namespaces
`````javascript  
	var xml = "<book><title xmlns='myns'>Harry Potter</title></book>"
    var doc = new dom().parseFromString(xml)    
    var node = select(doc, "//*[local-name(.)='title' and namespace-uri(.)='myns/']")[0]
    console.log(node.namespaceURI)
`````
-->
    
    myns
	
## Attributes
`````javascript  
    var xml = "<book author='J. K. Rowling'><title>Harry Potter</title></book>"
    var doc = new dom().parseFromString(xml)    
    var author = select(doc, "/book/@author")[0].value    
    console.log(author)
`````
-->
    
    J. K. Rowling
